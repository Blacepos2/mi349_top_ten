			<h3>What is Node.js?</h3>
			<p>
				To answer that question, we have to understand what JavaScript
				is. JavaScript is a language which is often used to make
				websites more interactive, but in order for it to work, it
				needs a runtime environment for it to do any computation on a
				local machine. Every browser that supports JavaScript needs an
				engine capable of executing the code. For example, Chrome uses
				an engine called v8 and Firefox uses an engine called SpiderMonkey.
				Before node, using a browser was pretty much the only way to
				execute JavaScript code.
			</p>
			<p>
				The concept behind Node.js is to create an environment for
				JavaScript to execute outside of a browser. Node.js is really just a C++
				program which uses Chrome's v8 engine to execute JavaScript code.
				Unlike a browser though, Node has a number of additional
				capabilities which make it ideal for server-side programming.
				For example, it can interact with the filesystem directly as
				well as send and receive HTTP requests.
			</p>

			<h3>Your First Program</h3>
			<p>
				You can download a binary for Node.js on their <a href="https://nodejs.org">main website</a>.
				From there, getting to a "Hello World!" program is super easy.
				Simply write the JavaScript code as you normally would, but this
				time, use the node executable instead of a browser.
			</p>
			<h5 class="filename">helloworld.js</h5>
			<pre>
<code>console.log("Hello World!");</code></pre>
			<p>
				To run the code, simply run the file using the node executable.
			</p>
			<pre>
<code>$ node helloworld.js</code></pre>

			<h3>Simple HTTP server</h3>
			<p>
				Node.js can be a little bit more useful than that though. We are
				now going to make a simple http server using the <code>http</code>
				module provided by Node.js.
			</p>
			<p>
				We are going to need to include the <code>http</code> module as
				it is not in the global scope by default. To create an object
				that represents the module, we can use the <code>require("modulename")</code>
				function
			</p>
			<pre>
<code>const http = require("http");</code></pre>
			<p>
				Next we are going to use a useful function in the module
				called <code>createServer</code>. This will return a server object
				which we can have listen on a port. It will also allow us to provide
				a callback function which will handle HTTP requests asynchronously.
			</p>
			<pre>
<code>const server = http.createServer((request, response) => {
    // handle requests here:

    response.setHeader("Content-Type", "text/plain");
    response.statusCode = 200;
    response.end("hello");

});</code></pre>
			<p>
				As you can see, the callback has two arguments, <code>request</code>
				and <code>response</code>. <code>request</code> is an object which stores a lot
				of information about what kind of request the server received. <code>response</code>
				is an object which we write to to prepare the content of our response.
			</p>
			<p>
				In our simple response, we do three things. The first is telling what kind
				of data we are sending with the "Content-Type" field of <code>setHeader</code>.
				We are sending plain text so we pass in "text/plain". The second is setting the
				status code so the client can know if their request was successful. Nothing went
				wrong on our end, so we write <code>response.statusCode = 200</code> to indicate
				this. Lastly, we use the <code>end</code> function to finalize our response and
				send the main content.
			</p>
			<p>
				The last thing we have to do is tell the server to listen on a port. We can do
				that with the <code>listen</code> method of the server we created:
			</p>
			<pre>
<code>server.listen(8000, "localhost", () => {
    console.log(`Server listening at http://${hostname}:${port}`);
});</code></pre>
			<p>
				The function accepts a port and a hostname. We can choose any port we want, but we
				will use 8000 because that is one typically used for testing. The hostname is an ip
				address. <code>localhost</code> is an address which represents the computer's own
				address, which is useful for now since we want to run and test the server on the same
				computer. The last argument is a callback function which will run when the server starts
				listening.
			</p>
			<p>
				We can now test the server. Run the program with Node.js like before and enter the
				url <a href="http://localhost:8000/">http://localhost:8000/</a>. You should get a
				blank page with the text "hello". 
			</p>
			<p>
				We can also do other things like distinguishing between endpoints. Doing this for
				a tiny webserver like this is pretty straightforward, we will just use a <code>switch</code>
				statement on the url. The url after the address can be retrieved from <code>request.url</code>.
			</p>
			<pre>
<code>const server = http.createServer((request, response) => {
    response.setHeader("Content-Type", "text/plain");
    
    switch (request.url) {
        case "/":
    	    response.statusCode = 200;
    	    response.end("Home page");
            break
        case "/endpoint1":
    	    response.statusCode = 200;
    	    response.end("You've reached endpoint 1!");
            break
        case "/endpoint2":
    	    response.statusCode = 200;
    	    response.end("Welcome to endpoint 2!");
            break
        default:
    	    response.statusCode = 404;
    	    response.end("Error, page not found");
    }

});</code></pre>
			<p>
				We have 3 valid urls that the client can visit: "localhost:8000", "localhost:8000/endpoint1",
				and "localhost:8000/endpoint2". In each of these cases, the server sends something
				different. If the client enters an endpoint that doesn't exist, like "localhost:8000/endpoint3",
				the server will always send the text <code>"Error, page not found"</code> along with the 
				404 status code.
			</p>

			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>
				There is a lot more to node than what this short tutorial covered, but hopefully
				you now understand the basics of how it works and what it can be used for.
